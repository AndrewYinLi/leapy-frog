I developed this Android game through Unity3D with C# as my first foray into mobile game development and to practice programming in C#. All of the graphics in the game and the code and scripts are exclusively mine and developed from scratch by me, however the sound effects found in the game were found through the Internet and used under the Creative Commons licensing agreement.

This game allowed me to gain experience in and exercise many different game engine concepts to me, including: hitboxes, casting rays, physics (adding force to an object to move it), instantiation of Unity prefabs, UI development, animations, and sprites.

The rules of the game are as follows: you are the frog and are constantly moving forward. Press the 'A' button on-screen to jump from platform to platform and on top of ducks flying toward you to kill them. Avoid letting the ducks hit you and falling into the water, as the game will end at that point.

The entire project is in this repository and the game itself is available for download here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IndepenguinGames.LeapyFrog or alternatively you can manually run WorkingBuild.apk in an Android virtual machine.
